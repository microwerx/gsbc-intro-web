## Assignment 1

## The HTML Template

* The default page is `index.html`.
* Let's look at a very basic HTML file.

Essential elements:

* `DOCTYPE`
* `charset`
* `html`, `head`, and `body` tags

## HTML Elements

The tag consists of an element name surrounded by "`<`" and "`>`" characters. Tag names are **case insensitive**. That means `<TITLE>`, `<Title>`, and `<title>` all refer to the same thing.

An HTML element can have **attributes** which give extra information about that element. For example, this image tag has an attribute that tells it the URL it should load.

```html
<img src="image.png" />
```

## The CSS Template

## The JavaScript Template

You can use the `<script>` tag to put JavaScript code right inside the HTML.

You can also use the `src`

## The DOM
