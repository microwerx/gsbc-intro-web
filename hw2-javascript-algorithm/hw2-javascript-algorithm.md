# Homework 2: JavaScript Algorithm

Create a new directory inside your repo and name it `hw2`. You will need to create the following three files inside of this directory:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `algorithm.js`

Your web page should contain three sections for each of the following problems:

- `Array of Integers`
- `The Largest Number`
- `The Sum`

## Array of Integers

- Generate an array with 100 random **integers** between 1 and 1000. You may want to use the `Math.random` function to assist you.
- Print the numbers as individual `<p>` elements inside the `Array of Integers` section.

## Largest Number

- Iterate through this array, and find the largest number.
- Print the number within a `<p>`  block using an `id` attribute and `document.getElementById(...)`.

## The Sum

- Iterate through this array and add all the numbers.
- Print the sum within a `<p>` block using an `id` attribute as you did with the previous section.

## Submission

- Submit HW2 via Teams with a working link to your URL.
- Your URL should look something like `https://yourusername.github.io/gsbc-intro-web/hw2/index.html`
