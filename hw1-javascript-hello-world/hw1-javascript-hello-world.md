# Homework 1: JavaScript Hello World

In this assignment, you will write your first *real* web page. It should be stored in `index.html` on the top level of your git repo. For now, it can live in a single file, but you may choose to create a `style.css` stylesheet that can be used by the remaining homeworks.

## Required Reading

Read Part 1 of Massimo Vignelli's [The Vignelli Canon](https://www.rit.edu/vignellicenter/sites/rit.edu.vignellicenter/files/documents/The%20Vignelli%20Canon.pdf).

Read Jerry Pournelle's [How to Get My Job](https://www.jerrypournelle.com/slowchange/myjob.html). *Goal: learn how to write a paragraph.*

## Essential Elements

* Use CSS to style the elements on your page in your **wyld style**.
* Model your page after the class example page. Please include a section ~"Site Links" to that will contain links to the remaining parts of your website.
* Include a section ~"About My Design" with a paragraph about your design style. Your paragraph should contain at least four sentences.
* Include a section ~"Design Influences" with a list (`<ul>`) of at least three links to other websites that really inspire you with their design. Put the most important one at the top. 
* Include a section called ~"My First Program" which will contain the output of your first JS program for this class. Here are some ideas for that first program
    * Change up the example script by printing something different than numbers.
    * Add a `<div id='helloworld'></div>` element and update its contents (see [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementbyid.asp)).
    * Add a button and a paragraph element and perform a calculation for the user (see [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp)).
* Write appropriate Git commit messages. I suggest prefixing with `HW1: what you did`.
