# Detailed Grading Criteria

## Homework Criteria

The homework grading is is graded as follows:

* (30 points) The homework solves the three requirements (1o points each) in the assignment. Full credit is received if the requirement is met. If it does not work, but a good attempt is made, half credit is earned.
* (20 points) GitHub has descriptive commit messages (less than 50 characters, describes work checked in). A message like "check in homework" would receive half credits and a message like "fixed logic to handleInput() method" would receive full credit.
* (30 points) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be stored in separate files. While it is possible to combine all three kinds of code in one file, it's not scalable for large projects. Keep them the HTML in `.html`, CSS in `.css`, and JavaScript in `.js` files to the maximum extent possible.
* (10 points) Source code needs to be documented. Half credit is given if every function has a descriptive comment. Full credit is given if the internals of a function also have descriptive comments.
* (10 points) Web sites need to be polished. Full credit is given if the web site has design and style applied. Try to come up with a nice CSS style to accompany your web sites. This credit is given if the homework is supposed to be a Markdown file.

## Project Criteria

Your project is graded as follows:

* (100 points) Biography and Proposal
  * (20 points) `/project/README.md` MarkDown is used for the report with level 1 and level 2 headings.
  * (20 points) Write a 1 paragraph biography about yourself in third person: "Dr. Jonathan Metzgar is a web programming instructor. ...". Please remember this is public, so treat it like the bio you'd see from an author on a book.
  * (20 points) 1 paragraph about websites you are inspired by. For example, The [Where is Webb?](https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html) site is really interesting because it summarizes all the real-time deployment details for this space telescope.
  * (20 points) 1 paragraph about the website you'd like to create along with high level goals for the project for the midterm and final.
  * (20 points) A first draft of the estimated timeframes for your project. Please be as detailed and realistic as you can be. **We will iterate over this last part.**
    * **Good:** "Create a CSS Style sheet (4 hours by 2/14)"
    * **Good:** "Research subject matter for web site (8 hours by 2/28)"
    * **Bad:** "Write JavaScript to allow user interaction with the website (4 hours by 1/28)"
    * **Good:** "Write JS logic to control left/right movements for player (4 hours by 2/14)"
* (150 points) Midterm Project Report
  * (20 points) A Working Website
  * (20 points) `style.css` CSS stylesheet
  * (20 points) `index.html` HTML root page
  * (20 points) User interface elements (`<button>`, `<textarea>`, etc.)
  * (20 points) `app.js` JavaScript logic which allow the website to do something interesting.
  * (20 points) All code is formatted nicely with comments.
  * (30 points) `Project/postmortem.md` A *postmortem* which briefly tells the story of how you *made* your website, what went wrong, and what went right.
* (150 points) Final Project Report
  * (20 points) A Working Website that has been greatly improved over the midterm epoch.
